<h1 class="title">Support for :exports options from code blocks</h1>
<p>According to the <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting-code-blocks.html#Exporting-code-blocks">Org mode docs</a>, it is possible to customize whether
  the code block will be exported or not.</p>
<h2>About the <code>#+RESULTS:</code> block</h2>
<p>Using Org Babel features, it is possible to set <code>:results output</code>
  to a code block and render the results within a <code>#+RESULTS:</code> code block:</p>
<pre class="src" lang="org">
#+begin_src ruby :results output :exports both
puts &quot;Hello world&quot;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello world
</pre>
<p>One thing about the <code>#+RESULTS:</code> code blocks, is that they exist in several forms:</p>
<ol>
  <li>As an accumulated group of inline examples:
    <pre class="src" lang="org">
#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
print &quot;like&quot;
print &quot;this&quot;
print &quot;etc...&quot;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: like
: this
: etc...
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>As an example code block.
    <pre class="src" lang="org">
#+begin_src ruby :results output :exports both
10.times {|n| puts n }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
#+end_example
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Also, in case <code>:results output code</code> is used, the results would
    be a src block of the same language as the original one.
    <pre class="src" lang="org">
#+begin_src ruby :results output code
counter = 0
10.times { puts &quot;puts &#39;#{counter += 1}&#39;&quot; } # Displayed in first code block
puts counter # Displayed in second code block
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ruby
puts &#39;1&#39;
puts &#39;2&#39;
puts &#39;3&#39;
puts &#39;4&#39;
puts &#39;5&#39;
puts &#39;6&#39;
puts &#39;7&#39;
puts &#39;8&#39;
puts &#39;9&#39;
puts &#39;10&#39;
10
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 10
    </pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Default options</h2>
<p>The default is to export only the code blocks.</p>
<p>The following is an code block written in Emacs Lisp
  and its result should not be exported.</p>
<pre class="src" lang="emacs-lisp">
(message &quot;hello world&quot;)
</pre>
<p>The following is a code block written in Python
  and its result should not be exported.</p>
<pre class="src" lang="python">
for i in range(0,12):
  print &quot;import this&quot;
</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2>:exports code</h2>
<p>Only the code would be in the output,
  the same as when no option is set.</p>
<pre class="src" lang="js">
var message = &quot;Hello world!&quot;;

console.log(message);
</pre>
<p>And as block example too:</p>
<pre class="src" lang="js">
var message = &quot;Hello world!&quot;;
for (var i = 0; i&lt; 10; i++) {
  console.log(message);
}
</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2>:exports none</h2>
<p>This omits both the resulting block,
  and the code block itself.</p>
<p>This should work as well when using an example block.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>:exports both</h2>
<pre class="src" lang="ruby">
Math::PI + 1
</pre>
<pre class="example">
4.14159265358979
</pre>
<p>Should behave the same when within a block example.</p>
<pre class="src" lang="ruby">
hello = &lt;&lt;HELLO
The following is a text
that will contain at least 10 lines or more
so that when C-c C-c is pressed
and Emacs lisp
evals what is inside of the block,
enough lines would be created
such that an example block 
would appear underneath the
block that was executed.
This happens after 10 lines by default.
HELLO
</pre>
<pre class="example">

</pre>
<h2>:exports results</h2>
<p>This option can&#8217;t be completely supported by OrgRuby since
  we would have to eval the code block using :lang,
  so Org Babel features would have to be implemented as well.</p>
<p>But in case the resulting block is within the Org mode file,
  the code block will be omitted and only the results block
  would appear.</p>
<pre class="example">
3.141592653589793
</pre>
<p>The same should happen when a block example is used instead:</p>
<pre class="example">
any string
any string
any string
any string
any string
any string
any string
any string
any string
any string
</pre>
<h2>When results are graphics&#8230;</h2>
<p>A code block which is evaled within a Org mode buffer
  using Org babel features will have its results appear within
  another code block prepended with a <code>#+RESULTS</code> directive.</p>
<p>A results block could also not be another example block,
  and just consist from a link to a file. This happens
  when the output is a graphic for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exports none</li>
  <li>Exports code
    <pre class="src" lang="dot">
digraph workflow {
  a -&gt; c;
  b -&gt; c;
}
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Exports both
    <pre class="src" lang="dot">
digraph workflow {
  a -&gt; c;
  b -&gt; c;
}
    </pre>
    <p><img src="workflow.png" alt="workflow.png" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>Exports results
    <p><img src="workflow.png" alt="workflow.png" /></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>When blocks have a name, the results should be the same</h2>
